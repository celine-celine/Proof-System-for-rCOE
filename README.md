## Rule Numbering Note
The paper uses consecutive numbering for the rules to enhance readability. Note that this numbering does not align with the complete version in this repository.
### Rationale & Usage Guidance
1. **Why the mismatch?**  
   - The main paper extracts a rule subset for conciseness, while the repository maintains the full logical structure.
2. **How to cross-reference?**  
   - Use **rule name** (not numbers) as the primary key when comparing versions.
